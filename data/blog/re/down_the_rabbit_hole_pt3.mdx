## Table of contents

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Table of Contents" toHeading={2} />

Picking up where I've left off, I will take a look at where the string is referenced.

## fcn.000109fc (printError)

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/printError-1.png)
</div>

This function starts with calling a protocol which is referenced in ```SystemErrorLogDxe.efi```, if the return value is not less than 0 (which I'm assuming means an error hasn't occured) the rest of the blocks are executed.

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/printError-2.png)
</div>

The offset that points to the error string (which is at ```0x10258```) is used in the last block to craft the error message.

I have no idea what rbx holds, but depending on the value in its offset, the hex format thats added at the end of our error string changes. When the whole string is crafted in the buffer, it's used as an argument in the next function call, which again I wasn't able to resolve. But this whole function looks like it's an error logging function.

This function has xrefs in ```fcn.00010b10```.

## fcn.00010b10 (checkID)

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/pciCheck0.png)
</div>

Up until this point, I didn't think of asking the most important question: **What does the application check to enforce the whitelist?** The answer is simple: Subsystem Device IDs. 

### Device ID table

The program has a hardcoded table of IDs sitting at offset ```0x10270```:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/idtable.png)
</div>

Each entry consists of the following:

```c
struct TableEntry {
    uint32_t category;      // Type of device
    uint16_t vendorID;      // Vendor ID
    uint16_t deviceID;      // Device ID
    uint32_t subsystemID;   // Subsystem Device ID
    uint32_t unknown;       // ???
}
```

When I checked the ID of my card with ```lspci -nn```:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/wificard.png)
</div>

I had to go deeper with ```lspci -x``` to find the subsystem ID:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/wificard2.png)
</div>

Meaning that:

```
Vendor ID:      8086        (Intel)
Device ID:      0085        (Centrino Advanced-N 6205 [Taylor Peak])
Subsystem ID:   8086:1311   (Centrino Advanced-N 6205 (802.11a/b/g/n))
```

My device's entry is at the offset ```0x102b0```.

I tried to identify the rest of the IDs using [this website](https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/) and with some googling:

```
Vendor ID   Subs. ID    Vendor      Subsystem

```

The table also holds USB device IDs. This makes sense because the protocol interface was also referenced in ```LenovoWmaUsbDxe.efi```.

Back to fcn.00010b10. Depending on the second argument (held in rdx) one of two block sets is executed. The argument is checked againts the following values: ```0, 1, 5```, which are familiar as they are the three possible values of the first value in each table entry (there's also ```6``` but it's used as the terminating value to mark the end of the table). One block is for values ```1, 5``` and the other block executes for the value ```0```. This is consistent with the ID table because entries with values ```1, 5``` are USB devices while the entries with ```0``` are PCI devices. I will skip the block for USB devices for obvious reasons.

### PCI ID check block (aka where the whitelist is enforced)

The block starts with checking for the terminating entry:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/pciCheck1.png)
</div>

Then the current entry is compared with the ID that was given as an argument to the function:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/pciCheck2.png)
</div>

If the comparison fails, the next entry is checked if it's the end of the table (```0x10caa```). If it is, the printError function is called (jump to ```0x10bcd```). If there are still entries left, the flow goes back to ```0x10c7b``` for the check on the next entry.

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/pciCheck3.png)
</div>

If the entry is identical with the ID, The last value in the entry is checked (```0x10cc5```). If it's ```1``` then ```unknownProtocolHandle2``` is called. After looking through the references I found that it's installed in the ```MiscGaIoDxe.efi``` application, which uses the protocol from ```CpuIo.efi```. The names themselves don't reveal much, so I still don't know what this block does.


> After some research on the entries, especially on the Intel cards, I found a feature that correlates with the values at the end of these entries. All the cards that is ```1``` features Intel vPro. One Intel card that does not have vPro also has a ```0``` value. I will assume that this is the case (Because of time constraints, I couldn't go deeper to find out what this protocol actually does. I will have to continue with this assumption). Since I do not want anything to do with vPro, I will not use this block in my modified flow.

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/pciCheck4.png)
</div>

After setting ```sil``` accordingly, ```LenovoScratchData``` variable of the card (that is unique to the guid) is read and the value that falls into ```var_44h``` is compared against ```sil```. If they're not equal, then the value is set and the data is written back.

Here's an interesting block:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/pciCheck5.png)
</div>

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/pciCheck6.png)
</div>

The current ID is compared against the device ```Centrino Advanced-N 6235 AGN``` (which already exists in the table) and if it's a match, ```LenovoScratchData``` is written back with the value at ```var_4fh``` set, then ```ResetSystem()``` function is called from the ```RuntimeServices``` table. No idea what this is for either.

After all this hassle, a couple more redundant operations are executed and the function returns. This function is referenced three times in ```InterfaceFunction```, each for a different type of device. There's not much to see in that function that's relevant to my goal, so I'll skip it entirely.

# Getting rid of the whitelist

Now that I know mostly (okay maybe partially) how this thing works, I know that there are different solutions to my problem, some of which are:

- Remove the efi application entirely from the BIOS.
- Modify the ID table, add my card's ID
- Modify the code flow, let any device go by

The first option seems risky as I don't know how the other applications will behave when the ```LocateProtocol``` call fails. The second one seems the safest and the most convenient because there are many entries in the table that I will never use. However, I'm here to slay the whitelist and that's what I shall do.

## Modifying the program flow

What I want to do is let the whitelist take care of the cards that are already in the table and not go into the error function for the rest. To accomplish this, I will modify the block in which the last entry is checked. If a card is compared against all entries and there are no other entries, the error function will be called. This part happens in the block ```0x10caa```:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/pciCheck7.png)
</div>

This jump goes to the ```printError``` function. I will change it to ```0x10de3``` so that there is no error and the program will continue like the card is authorized.

After this anticlimactic solution, it's time time to put this back into the image and flash it.

# Putting everything back together

To test if the modification works successfully, I used an Intel Wireless-N 135 card from my old laptop. I put the card in and tried to boot my machine. The result was expected (sorry for the potato quality):

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/photo-error.jpg)
</div>

Then I tore the machine down and connected the BIOS chip to the USB programmer:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/photo-motherboard.jpg)
</div>

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/photo-usb.jpg)
</div>

I dumped the current BIOS and patched it using UEFIPatch tool. I've created a pattern to patch the image:

```
79E0EDD7-9D1D-4F41-AE1A-F896169E5216 10 P:0AFFFFFF:20010000 
```

I erased the chip and then wrote the modified image back using the programmer's software:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/usbProgrammer.png)
</div>

After verifying the written image, I put everything back together and tried to boot the machine. The machine did boot! The wifi card was recognized and I was able to connect to my router. I could see the card in the ```lspci``` output:

<div>
![img](/static/images/2019-03-28-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt3/lspci.png)
</div>

# But wait, there's more?

No, just kidding :). I accomplished what I've set out to do and learned a lot in the process. I hope I was able to pass it on. Now, off to other adventures. Thanks for reading.
