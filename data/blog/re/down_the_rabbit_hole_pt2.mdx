After dumping my laptop's BIOS and extracting its UEFI modules, I searched for the relevant error string and found an efi application named `LenovoWmaPolicyDxe.efi`. It's time to analyze and understand this binary.

I've uploaded an untouched image carved from the official update iso from Lenovo's website. If you want to follow along you can download it from [here](https://gist.github.com/erfur/c1461af7475665d6f7ba13b5c04b74c3).

> In this post I will analyze the generic structures and functions of the EFI application with radare2. Since I also wanted to introduce radare2, I will have a beginner-friendly approach. I added an appendix to list the commands I used in radare2. In the next and final post I will analyze and modify/remove the whitelist mechanism itself.

# Always be prepared

First of all, let me recap what I do know about this binary and what I expect to find inside:

- It's a (in my case x86-64) PE binary with little-endian encoding.
- EFI applications interface with each other through specified functions.
- The binary is probably statically linked and stripped.
- If I can resolve the interfaces and the services being used, I will be able understand what's going on.

# Getting right into it

[Opening the binary with r2](#starting-r2) and [analyzing](#analysis) with `aaaaaa`(one more 'a' and a radare2 developer will knock on my door, no need to bother them for now), then switching to [visual mode](#visual-mode), I get to see the entry of the application. Wasting no time, I [find the offset](#strings) of the error string and [jump right to it](#jumping-around).

First thing to do is to check where this string is being referenced in the code. [Checking the xref](#references) results in a surprise:

```
[addr.xrefs]> 0x0000000000010510 # (TAB/jk/q/?)

(no xrefs)
```

\*sigh\* That's just great. I have a string that isn't referenced in any part of the program. Now what do I do?

# A _little_ detour

I literally had nightmares about this string after not being able to find any xrefs. At this point my dreams were crushed. Not knowing what to do, I will start analyzing the functions one by one to see if anything comes up. Fortunately there aren't many functions to look at, so that's something. Let me show you how the [function list](#functions) looks before analysis:

```

0x00011ca0    4 17           fcn.00011ca0
```

Analyzing these functions will hopefully help me uncover some of the mysteries of EFI applications. I will begin with the most obvious function since I do not yet know where to go.

---

## Entry function

Any variable that's used in the entry0 function will probably be useful later. Before anything else, I need to know about the calling convention used in this type of binaries.

### Calling convention in EFI applications

From the latest [UEFI Specification document](http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI%20Spec%202_7_A%20Sept%206.pdf):

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/calling-convention-1.png)</div>

The calling convention is specified for each architecture. Specification for x64 systems is:

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/calling-convention-2.png)</div>

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/calling-convention-3.png)</div>

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/calling-convention-4.png)</div>

I also looked for EFI application development tutorials. The [simplest EFI application](http://x86asm.net/articles/uefi-programming-first-steps/) looks like this:

```c
#include <efi.h>

EFI_STATUS main(EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle, EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE *SystemTable)
{
  return EFI_SUCCESS;
}
```

Now I need to [import these types into r2](#types). However around the time I was writing this piece, r2 was actually not able to parse `behemoth.h`(which is the best option to get every type at once) from [ida-efiutils](https://github.com/snare/ida-efiutils/blob/master/behemoth.h), but got an update that fixed the issue. Although, it's still not able to fully parse it because of its humongous size, so I had to cut out a big (hopefully not necessary) chunk of it. You can find the file in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/erfur/c1461af7475665d6f7ba13b5c04b74c3). Anyway, this is still better than handcrafting a custom header file.

Now I can go through the function.

<div>![img](/static/image/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/entry0-1-after.png)</div>

Unfortunately, r2 guessed the [function arguments](#function-arguments-and-variables) incorrectly (Hopefully it will improve in the future). The function `fcn.000119a4` is called immediately, which means that arguments `ImageHandle` and `SystemTable` are passed to it. Let me quickly take a look:

<div>![img](/static/image/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/inittable-after.png)</div>

This function is a pretty small and straightforward one. It takes the `SystemTable` and extracts two pointers and puts them into somewhere in memory. I will [rename](#creating-renaming-flags) this function to `InitTable` and mark these offsets accordingly.

`SystemTable` goes into 0x11d98, and (using the offsets in [this file](https://github.com/snare/ida-efiutils/blob/master/structs.idc)) the variable at offsets:

- 0x60 is `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES *BootServices`
- 0x58 is `EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES *RuntimeServices`

Back to entry0. After naming these memory offsets, I saw that the function at `SystemTable.BootServices+0x140`, which points to `LocateProtocol` function, is called four times.

<div>![img](/static/image/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/entry0-2-after.png)</div>

If any of these blocks fail, the program exits with a negative value.

### LocateProtocol function

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/locateprotocol.png)</div>

This means that RCX will hold the pointer to GUID for the protocol and R8 will hold the memory address that will keep the interface. To name these memory addresses, I need to know what protocol is being called. In UEFI, protocols are registered with GUIDs. First I need to know how GUIDs are kept in memory, then I will try to resolve them.

### GUID struct

GUIDs are stored in the following struct:

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/guid.png)</div>

To see the bytes in the correct order, I use formatted print:

```
:> pfq x[2]w[8]b
0x03583ff6
[ 0xcb36, 0x4940 ]
[ 0x94, 0x7e, 0xb9, 0xb3, 0x9f, 0x4a, 0xfa, 0xf7 ]
```

Which corresponds to the GUID `03583FF6-CB36-4940-947E-B9B34AFAF7`. When I searched for this GUID in the UEFI dump, nothing showed up. I found a [GUID dump](https://gist.github.com/Velocet/d394281d96191e235ff46a8aa2018d80) and found that this GUID belongs to `EfiSmbiosProtocol`. I wasn't this lucky with all of the GUIDs. I failed to resolved the second and the third. Here's the table so far:

```
03583FF6-CB36-4940-947E-B9B39F4AFAF7  EfiSmbiosProtocol
3161DDAB-9600-4301-AAB2-93006395824A  UnknownProtocol1
44029FA7-AB98-4506-966C-32D2DEEB2A0A  UnknownProtocol2
E6F014AB-CB0E-456E-8AF7-7221EDB702F7  TpAcpiNvs
```

Right after four LocateProtocol blocks, the last block of entry0 is executed:

<div>![img](/static/image/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/entry0-3-after.png)</div>

First of all, I want to know the call being made. `BootServices+0x80` points to the `InstallProtocolInterface` function.

### InstallProtocolInterface function

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/installprotocolinterface-1.png)</div>
<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/installprotocolinterface-2.png)</div>
<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/installprotocolinterface-3.png)</div>

So here's what is happening:

- A new interface is being installed into `TpAcpiNvs` handle.
- The function at `0x10e0c` (which isn't in the function list that was generated after the analysis) is being used for this protocol. I will name the function `InterfaceFunction`.
- This protocol has the GUID `4212A9D4-4A92-4BFB-B47F-2734355F54AC` (Searching for this GUID yields references in `LenowoWmaUsbDxe.efi` and `LenovoWmaPciDxe.efi`)

I named the handle `SelfHandle`. After the call to InstallProtocol, the handle is put into `0x11d88`, `fcn.00011960` is called with the arguments `(0x10, fcn.00010fc4, 0, &var_20h)` and then rax is set to 0 and the program returns.

Now, at this point I have three unknown functions, two unknown protocols and no xref to my string. I will continue with `fcn.00011960`.

<div>![img](/static/image/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/createeventfunction-after.png)</div>

`BootServices+0x170` is the `CreateEventEx` function:

### CreateEventEx Function

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/createeventex-1.png)</div>
<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/createeventex-2.png)</div>

In `fcn.00011960` this function is called with the arguments `(0x200, 0x10, fcn.00010fc4, 0, 0x10470, &var_20h)`. `fcn.00010fc4` uses the UnknownProtocol1, so I do not know what it actually does. I will rename `fcn.00011960` to `CreateEventFunction` and `fcn.00010fc4` to `UnknownProtocol1Function`.

I honestly have no idea what this event does, so I will skip it for now and carry on to the `InterfaceFunction`, but first I want to find the standard functions such as printf, strcpy, memcpy and so on as these functions will help me understand what is going on more easily.

## Standard functions

### fcn.00011ca0 (strlen)

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/strlen.png)</div>

Well, this one looks pretty straighforward. Counting bytes until the byte is equal to zero sounds like **strlen()**.

### fcn.00011128 (memset)

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/memset.png)</div>

This one looks like **memset()**.

### fcn.00011c64 (strncpy)

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/strncpy.png)</div>

Copying bytes from the address in rdx to the address in rcx, while checking for a null byte, then using memset() on the remaining bytes is exactly what happens when **strncpy()** is called.

### fcn.00011264 (vsnprintf)

This is one big function, however something as little as these lines give it away immediately:

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/vsnprintf-2.png)</div>

These look like format string operators! I assume that I'm looking at a **printf** function. This function only has one xref (`fcn.00011640`) and that function looks like a wrapper function.

### fcn.00011640 (snprintf)

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/snprintf.png)</div>

Judging by the arguments it's called with in xrefs, this function might be **snprintf()**. This makes me think that the previous function is probably **vsnprintf()**.

Looking at the global call graph, there are several functions that are only invoked in vsnprintf. I will rename them and analyze them later when it's absolutely necessary. However there are two functions that call snprintf. I feel like I should take a look at them.

### fcn.000111ac (printGUID)

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/printguid.png)</div>

The string gives this function away. This one must be a GUID print function.

### fcn.00011660 (strerror_r)

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/strerror.png)</div>

I've got lots of error codes and strings. It looks like this function prints the error string to the given buffer based on the status code. This function is probably a custom **strerror_r()**.

### fcn.00011140 (AllocatePoolWrapper)

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/allocatepoolwrapper.png)</div>

`BootService+0x40` (which is `AllocatePool`) is called in this function.

#### AllocatePool function

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/allocatepool.png)</div>

This is basically a syscall for allocating memory. I will name this one `AllocatePoolWrapper` and look at the calling function.

### fcn.0001116c (malloc)

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/malloc.png)</div>

If the `AllocatePoolWrapper` succeeds and returns a buffer, the buffer is initialized to `\x00` by the `BootServices+0x168` which is `SetMem`. This function looks a lot like **malloc()**.

# A step in the right direction

The function list now looks like this:

```
:> afl
0x00010960    4 156          fcn.00010960
0x000109fc    6 276          fcn.000109fc

0x00011ca0    4 17           strlen
```

Also my [callgraph](#callgraphs) looks like this:

<div>![img](/static/images/2019-02-16-down_the_rabbit_hole_pt2/callgraph.png)</div>

I analyzed and resolved most of the infrastructure. Then suddenly I had a thought:

> What if the error string's offset is saved somewhere in the memory and used as a reference?

The string is stored at `0x10510`. Its absolute offset from the beginning of the binary is `0x510`. When I searched for `\x10\x05` something came up:

```
:> /x 1005
Searching 2 bytes in [0x11ea0-0x11ec0]
hits: 0
Searching 2 bytes in [0x11de0-0x11ea0]
hits: 0
Searching 2 bytes in [0x10240-0x11de0]
hits: 1
0x00010258 hit1_0 1005
```

And when I checked the xrefs for that address:

```
:> axt @hit1_0
fcn.000109fc 0x10a8e [DATA] mov r8, qword [0x00010258]
```

_Bingo._ My error string is being referenced by a reference in `fcn.000109fc`. In the next and final post I will quicky analyze the remaining four unknown functions and see how I can get rid of the whitelist once and for all.

_cya on the next one._

# Appendix: Radare2 usage in detail

> Note: Always use the git version of radare2. It's constantly updated and fixed so you might get a fix or a feature you didn't even know you needed.

## Starting r2

Opening a binary(or any file) is as easy as:

```
$ r2 body.bin
```

This will spawn r2's shell. From here on it is r2 territory.

## Analysis

Analysis happens on various levels. The simplest analysis can be run by typing:

```
[0x0001101c]> aa
[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)
```

It is possible to run more in-depth analysis by increasing the number of a's.

```
[0x0001101c]> aaaaaa
[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)
[x] Analyze function calls (aac)
[x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar)
[x] Constructing a function name for fcn.* and sym.func.* functions (aan)
[x] Enable constraint types analysis for variables
```

## Visual mode

To switch to r2's visual mode simply type `V` in the shell (If you want to jump to the function callgraph directly, type `VV`). There are several viewmodes in visual mode, two of which are hexdump mode and the dissassembly mode. To rotate view modes, `p/P` can be used. The shell can be invoked with `:` when you're in visual mode. The rest of the commands can be listed with `?`.

## Strings

Strings can be listed with `iz` (for data sections) and `izz` (for the whole binary). This list can be grepped inside r2 shell. Strings can also be searched directly with `/ foo` (ASCII) and `/w foo` (wide strings). After the search, r2 will create flags like `hit0_1` on the matching offsets so that you can easily access them.

## Jumping around

Changing the offset is done with the `s` command in the shell. In visual mode, `o` will allow you to jump to both addresses and flags and `_` will list the available flags, allowing search.

## References

Reference commands are under `ax`. You can list reference-related commands with `ax?` (Any command and its extensions can be listed with adding a question mark at the end). References to flags can be listed with `axF` and references to addresses can be listed with `axt`. In visual mode you can list the xrefs to the current offset with `x`.

## Functions

Functions can be listed with `afl`. For a more verbose output, `afll` can be used. In visual mode, `v` opens the functions/variables analysis menu.

## Types

Type commands are under `t`. To list loaded basic types use `t`, for loaded structs use `ts` and for typedefs use `tt`. To import types from a C header file, use `to <path>`. If you want to enter a type by hand, use `to -`. This command will spawn the editor registered in `cfg.editor` (this can be changed with `e cfg.editor=<editor>`). Function argument/variable types can be changed using `afvt [name] [type]`.

## Function arguments and variables

Function arguments and variables are manipulated through `afv?` commands. To rename vars use `afvn [newname] [oldname]`. You can remove vars with `afv- [name]`.

## Creating and renaming flags

Flags of any kind can be created with `f [name] @[address]`. To remove a flag use `f- [name]` or `f- @[address]`. In visual mode you can use `d` to define a flag at the current offset. You can also use `b` or `_` to browse flags.

## Callgraphs

Graphs are generated with `ag?` commands. For example, interactive ascii art of global callgraph can be generated with `agCv` and graphviz dot model of global callgraph can be generated with `agCd` (which is what I used for the graph in this post).
